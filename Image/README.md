# Image Display Example

This example demonstrates how to display images using both relative and absolute URLs in an HTML document.

## HTML Code

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <body>
        <h1>Image</h1>
        <!---Relative URL--->
        <img src="ayang2.jpg" alt="Webtoon Character">
        <br>
        <!---Absolute URL--->
        <img style="width: 250px; height:250px;" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/0084f504a0bd8410db5be652229e6ee0/edd8039efab3fb80-05/s1280x1920/87ec6db552bd60f969804d41ddc2f772d32619fd.jpg" alt="Webtoon Character">
    </body>
</html>
```

## Description

- **Relative URL**: The first image is linked using a relative URL, meaning the image file (`ayang2.jpg`) should be located in the same directory as the HTML file.
  
- **Absolute URL**: The second image is linked using an absolute URL, which is a direct link to an image hosted on a website. The image is styled to have a width and height of 250 pixels.

## Usage

To use this HTML file:

1. Save the HTML code in a file with a `.html` extension (e.g., `index.html`).
2. Ensure that the image file `ayang2.jpg` is located in the same directory as your HTML file.
3. Open the HTML file in a web browser to view the images.

## Notes

- Ensure the relative image file (`ayang2.jpg`) is in the correct path relative to the HTML file.
- The absolute URL image will be displayed as long as the link is valid and the image is accessible.
