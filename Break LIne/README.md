# HTML Code Explanation

This repository contains a simple HTML example that demonstrates the use of line breaks and horizontal rules.

## HTML Code

```html
<html>
    <body>
        <h1>Break Line</h1>
        <p>This Is a Paragraph
            <br>
            This Is the Next Line
            <hr>
            This Is The Next Line With Horizontal Rule
        </p>
    </body>
</html>
```

## Description

- `<h1>Break Line</h1>`: Defines a top-level heading with the text "Break Line".
- `<p>`: Defines a paragraph.
  - `This Is a Paragraph`: Text within the paragraph.
  - `<br>`: Inserts a line break, causing the following text to appear on a new line.
  - `This Is the Next Line`: Text that appears immediately after the line break.
  - `<hr>`: Inserts a horizontal rule (a horizontal line) that separates the content.
  - `This Is The Next Line With Horizontal Rule`: Text that appears after the horizontal rule.

## Purpose

This example demonstrates basic HTML elements used for formatting text:
- Line breaks (`<br>`)
- Horizontal rules (`<hr>`)

Feel free to modify the code to experiment with these elements and see how they affect the layout of the content.
