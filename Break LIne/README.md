# HTML Break Line Example

This repository contains a simple HTML example demonstrating the use of the `<br>` tag to create a line break within a paragraph.

## HTML Code

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <body>
        <h1>Break Line</h1>
        <p>This Is a Paragraph
            <br>
            This Is the Next Line
        </p>
    </body>
</html>
```

## Explanation

- `<html>`: The root element that defines the HTML document.
- `<body>`: Contains the content of the HTML document.
- `<h1>`: A heading element used for the title "Break Line".
- `<p>`: A paragraph element containing the text.
- `<br>`: A line break element used to insert a break within the paragraph.

## Usage

To view the HTML file, simply open it in a web browser. The paragraph will display "This Is a Paragraph" followed by "This Is the Next Line" on the next line within the same paragraph.
