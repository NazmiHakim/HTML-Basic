## How to Use Emojis in HTML

### Example

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <body>
        <h1>Hello &#x1F600; &#128513; &#x1F603;</h1>
    </body>
</html>
```

In this example, the following emojis are displayed:
- 😀 (Grinning Face, `U+1F600`, decimal 128512)
- 😁 (Beaming Face, `U+1F601`, decimal 128513)
