# Simple HTML Example

This is a simple HTML example to demonstrate the basic structure of an HTML document and how to use paragraphs. 

## HTML Code

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <body>
        <h1>Studying HTML</h1>

        <p>Im Studying HTML Right Now</p>

        <p>All Website
            Use HTML
            To Make Their Page
        </p>
    </body>
</html>
```

## Explanation

1. **HTML Structure**: The document starts with the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration which defines the document type and HTML version. This is followed by the `<html>` tag which encapsulates the entire HTML document.
   
2. **Body Section**: The `<body>` tag contains the content of the HTML document. Inside the body, we have:
    - A header (`<h1>`) which contains the title "Studying HTML".
    - Two paragraphs (`<p>`) which provide additional information.

3. **Paragraphs**: 
    - The first paragraph (`<p>Im Studying HTML Right Now</p>`) is a simple statement about studying HTML.
    - The second paragraph demonstrates that HTML can handle text over multiple lines within the same paragraph tags, although it will be rendered as a single paragraph in the browser.

## Notes

- HTML is a markup language used to create the structure of web pages. Every website uses HTML to some extent.
- Proper syntax and structure are important for ensuring that web pages render correctly across different browsers.
